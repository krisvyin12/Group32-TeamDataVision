## Subject
COS30045 – Data Visualisation

## Overview
This project aims to [briefly describe your project goal — e.g., analyse and visualise road accident data in Malaysia to identify high-risk areas and yearly trends].  
The visualisation will use D3.js to create interactive charts that support exploratory data analysis and storytelling.

## Data Source
- **Dataset:** [Dataset Name]
- **Source:** [Kaggle / data.gov.my / World Bank / etc.]
- **Format:** CSV
- **Governance:** Public dataset (no personally identifiable information).  
- **Processing Tool:** KNIME (workflow provided in `/knime/` folder).

## Progress
- Shared GitHub repository created ✅  
- Dataset collected and imported into KNIME ✅  
- Data cleaned and preprocessed ✅  
- Initial exploratory data analysis performed ✅  
- Drafted project introduction and purpose ✅  

## Next Steps
- Refine KNIME workflow and export cleaned dataset  
- Develop D3.js visualisations and webpage layout  
- Add interactivity and responsive design  
- Finalise design book for submission

## AI Declaration
Artificial Intelligence tools were used in a limited capacity for this project to assist with **grammar refinement, formatting, and explanation of coding concepts**.  
Specifically, OpenAI’s ChatGPT (GPT-5) was used to:
- Clarify KNIME node functions and data preprocessing logic  
- Suggest code structure and naming conventions for D3.js  
- Improve readability of documentation and README.md  

All final coding decisions, dataset preparation, analysis, and design were conducted and verified by the project team.  
No AI-generated text, visualisations, or data were directly copied without human review or modification.
